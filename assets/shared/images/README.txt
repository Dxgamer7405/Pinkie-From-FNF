This mod is inspired by Stepmania. I do not own Stepmania at all.

How To Install
-------------

1. Open the ZIP file.

2. Copy the "NOTE_assets.png" and "Note_assets.xml" files.

3. Go to your folder that has Friday Night Funkin in it.

4. Go to assets > images

5 (OPTIONAL). Find the original "NOTE_assets.png" and "NOTE_assets.xml" files and rename them to "NOTE_assets BACKUP" so you can swap out the note graphics if you'd like.

6. Paste the "NOTE_assets.png" and "Note_assets.xml" files that you copied from the ZIP file.

7. You will be given a prompt. Click "Replaces the files in the destionation".

8. Once the files are added, open the Friday Night Funkin exe.

If you go to a song, the new noteskin should appear.

It's OVER discord. You're reign of chaos and madness is OVER!


Spike, take a letter!

Dear Princess Celestia. Friendship is one of the most important things anypony can learn. it has the power to end chaos, mend connections, and even stop a crazy draconequus. But today. i've learned an even greater power that friendship can only dream of surpassing. The magic of funkin. It was today discovered the strength of an eight-o'-eight. The stamina of a Serum preset. The grandness of Fruity Reverb 2! This is a farewell letter of graditude. For for teaching me friendship, and as of seeing this letter, i am no longer your student and am being mentored by DJ Pon3 to learn how to use Ableton Live and VSTcrack.online. I bid you fare well. Your former student, Twilight Sparkle.
